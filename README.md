# Pandas
This is a project that was completed while taking the Udemy course -Â Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass.

This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. The data was explored and understood using the pandas library.
